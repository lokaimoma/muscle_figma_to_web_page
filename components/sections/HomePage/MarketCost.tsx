                  The term &#8220;SEO&#8221; refers to a broad range of tactics

                <p className="w-[80%] text-[20px] my-5">
                  SEO is important since 80% of consumers begin their product
                  investigation online. From the perspective of the customer, a
                  business that doesn&apos;t show up in search results
                  doesn&apos;t exist. Your chances of converting that consumer
                  into a customer are drastically reduced as a result.
                </p>
                <p className="w-[80%] text-[20px] my-5">
                  Another factor that makes SEO important? The first page of
                  search results is where about 75% of people stay. Your
                  audience will be substantially less if your website
                  doesn&apos;t show up on the first page, which will have an
                  effect on your revenue.
                </p>
                <p className="w-[80%] text-[20px] my-5">
                  For both conventional and online enterprises, SEO is crucial.

                  Businesses who invest a lot of money in SEO see great returns.
                  However, businesses often spend between $1500 and $5000 per
                  month on SEO, either internally or when working with an SEO
                  service. Some businesses will perform better than this

                  <p className="w-[80%] text-[20px] my-5">
                    PPC is the abbreviation for an advertising technique that
                    uses a pay-per-click price structure. Instead than paying
                    ahead for typical advertising, your organization only pays
                    when someone clicks on it. PPC is currently among the most
                    economical ad solutions for organizations because to this
                    price mechanism.

                    A PPC ad could show up in search results among other places.
                    Your business gains a key position at the top of search
                    results with a PPC ad. PPC is a go-to method for companies
                    developing their SEO strategy because of this.

                  <p className="w-[80%] text-[20px] my-5">
                    PPC also guides consumers to a pertinent page on your

                    PPC is a reliable digital advertising method since companies
                    make $2 for every $1 they put in it. Even better, those who
                    click on advertising are 50% more likely to make a purchase

                    Rather of consumers who are only researching a product, PPC
                    targets users who are ready to buy. However, you must
                    provide them a simple and user-friendly website if you want
                    them to finish their transaction. Therefore, it&apos;s
                    critical to budget for regular website maintenance expenses.

                    Both text and images are very helpful to customers. Before
                    making a purchase, consumers read roughly 12 pieces of
                    material, which explains why well-written content, from
                    sales copy to blog entries, is in demand.

                    Through social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, and
                    LinkedIn, social media marketing aims to raise brand
                    recognition for your business. Social networking may
                    sometimes promote website visits and sales.

                    Although brand recognition doesn&apos;t yield immediate
                    benefits, it can have long-term benefits. Because you are
                    active on social media, a user who follows your business
                    there, for instance, can end up being more devoted. They
                    could even recommend your company to their family and
                    friends.
